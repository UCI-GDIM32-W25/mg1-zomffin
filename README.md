# HW1
## Devlog
1. Isabel (or Zom) Matsuno, they/them

2. From the plan, many of the attributes we wrote were already present (ie. the sprite renderers, Ui, etc). I did have to implement some of the "actions" we noted, like the ability to move and plant things being present in Update(), as well as filling in the method from PlantCountUI UpdateSeeds(). The plan didn't change much at all, although I ended up adding some mechanics that weren't present in the original example, so I had to make those up on the fly.
